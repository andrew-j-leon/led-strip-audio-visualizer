1) Re-write in C++
2) Launch from command line just like other command line programs (e.g. grep)
	E.g. "audio-visualizer --config-file <path_to_config_file>
3) Try and use autotools to make installation easier (just type 'make' and you can start using the program)
4) For terminal version, pass in things like the port (/dev/ttyACM0) & baudrate? as command line arguments; leave things like color pallettes for config files (then pass their location via command line arguments)
5) Make 3D visualizer kinda like this (where x-axis is time; each row is a different frequency?) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOLHZk45K8I&ab_channel=Kurenai
6) Add --verbose option
7) Add options to override settings; what should happen if all required settings are met with options? No setting_filename required?
